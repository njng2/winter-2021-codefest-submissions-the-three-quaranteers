#Bathroom Finder 

The Bathroom Finder is a maps tool for users to find the nearest bathroom and filter their choices  
based on cleanliness, proof of purchase requirement, single stalled or multi-stalled.  

This app uses Swift, Googles Maps, and Firebase.

Sign up, and allow the app permissions to access your current location 

Once you've set your permissions, it is time to find your bathroom. 

Navigate to the search bar, and type in the nearest restaurants, coffee shop or whatever food/beverage you fancy and press search 

It will take you to the nearest place near you and the routes. 

You may also rate and write reviews about the bathroom!
