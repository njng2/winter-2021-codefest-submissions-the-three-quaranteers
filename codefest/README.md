## About this app:

**Have you ever been outside and you really needed to use the bathroom?** **Or that you didn't know that you had to buy something before using the bathroom?** **Or if you walked into a really gross bathroom?** **Well- this app we built could help with that!**

**The Toilecator** is a maps tool for users to find the nearest bathroom and filter their choices  
based on cleanliness, proof of purchase requirement, single stalled or multi-stalled.  

This app uses Swift, Google Maps, and Firebase and Cloud Firestore for realtime database.


## To get started:

Sign up, and allow the app permissions to access your current location 

Once you've set your permissions, it is time to find your bathroom. 

Navigate to the search bar, and type in the nearest restaurants, coffee shop or whatever food/beverage shop you fancy and press search 

It will take you to the nearest place near you and the routes and you can choose your bathroom based on other users' reviews and rates! 

**You may also rate and write reviews about the bathroom!**
